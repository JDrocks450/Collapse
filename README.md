# Welcome to SpongeBob SquarePants: Collapse!
This project restores the game to it's former glory, rewritten in C# and MonoGame.

## Getting Started
Building the project requires the following prerequesites to be met:
- [x] GUI2.dll Referenced (Project Reference)
- [x] GlacierEngine.dll Referenced (Project Reference)
- [x] MonoGame 3.7 or later installed.
    > _Note: You may need to use 3.7 as 3.8 and above are handled through NuGet and may give you headaches. 3.7 is fine for this application._

GUI2 and GlacierEngine are both repositories available publicly on my GitHub. Clone the repos and add them to your solution, or use the Releases for each one and reference the DLL.

## Playing the Game
Download the latest Release from this repository and run the included executable.
